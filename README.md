# BeSmart-Password-Generator

This project solves the security concern of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be prompted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.

The new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.

The criteria that the password is able to meet are: <br>

1) The password is between 12 - 128 characters long, AND <br>

2) The password must have at least one of the following character types: <br>
    *lowercase characters <br>
    *uppercase characters <br>
    *special characters <br>
    *numeric characters <br>
